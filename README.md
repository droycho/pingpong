# Ping Pong

#### Webpage designed to demonstrate back-end business logic using Arrays and Looping, {April 1, 2016}

#### By **DJ Roychoudhury**

## Description

This webpage is not meant to be very exciting, most of the magic is happening in the JavaScript. There are two purposes here: one purpose is to demonstrate understanding of looping and arrays, the other is to separate interface code from business logic code for ease of editing in the future.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* clone repository to your desktop
* once all files are in the proper directory, open the index.html page in web browser and everything should run fine.
* I will be adding the gh-pages branch to allow ease of access without need for cloning. Just ran out of time to complete that extra step.
